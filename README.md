# Club Takehome

During this test, you'll need to develop a minimal chat interface based on the [design on figma](https://www.figma.com/file/32YI2YtVas5aOjYKXhchev/Chat-take-home?node-id=0%3A1).

You will need to use this github as a starter, create one or multiple pages based on your decision that will lead to match the design.

### Chat data API

Chat data are already fetched server side. Your move to transfer them to the client by props or Redux!

### Run the project

- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Run Next.js: `yarn start` or using Run and Debug tab from Visual Studio Code
- Check it on http://localhost:3000 (port may change if already taken)

### Verification

You don't need to deploy your project for verification. You can push it in github or send us through a zip file. What is important for us is that we only need to use `yarn start` in order to see your work, nothing more.

Start simple and go deep, that's how we work.
